[
  { "ProductID": "P001", "ProductName": "Product A", "Category": "Cat X", "Price": 100 },
  { "ProductID": "P002", "ProductName": "Product B", "Category": "Cat Y", "Price": 150 },
  { "ProductID": "P003", "ProductName": "Product C", "Category": "Cat X", "Price": 200 }
]
```

1. GET Request
   - Use HTTP Request activity to call the GET endpoint.
   - Store response in a string variable.
   - Deserialize JSON into a DataTable using Deserialize JSON Array.
   - Iterate through rows with For Each Row to log or process data.
2. POST Request
   - Prepare payload as JSON string (use Assign activity).
   - Use HTTP Request activity to call the POST endpoint.
   - Include headers for authentication if required (Bearer token or API key).
   - Validate response for success (HTTP 200 / 201).
3. Optional: Write retrieved data from GET request into Excel using Write Range.
