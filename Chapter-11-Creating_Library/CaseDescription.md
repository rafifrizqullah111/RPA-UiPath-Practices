# ðŸ“˜ Create Library Practice (UiPath)

This section contains **hands-on practice cases** for learning how to create, manage, and reuse libraries in UiPath.  
Each case is designed to help you build modular, reusable components for enterprise automation projects.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Cases Overview

### 01. Simple & Parameterized Library
- Build a small workflow performing a basic operation (e.g., string formatting, calculation) and make it reusable with input/output arguments.  
- **Covers:** `Invoke Workflow`, `Arguments`, `Library Publishing`.

### 02. Exception-Handled Library
- Design a library workflow with built-in exception handling to improve robustness.  
- **Covers:** `Try Catch`, `Log Message`, `Throw`, `Retry Scope`.

### 03. Library with Dependencies & Versioning
- Build a library workflow that uses other internal workflows or NuGet packages and publish it with proper versioning.  
- **Covers:** `Invoke Workflow`, `Manage Packages`, `Library Dependencies`, `Publish Library`, `Manage Versions`.

### 04. Using Library in Multiple Projects
- Import the created library into multiple UiPath projects and invoke workflows to test reusability.  
- **Covers:** `Manage Packages`, `Invoke Workflow`, `Arguments Mapping`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
By completing these 4 cases, you will gain hands-on experience in:  
- Building modular, reusable workflows  
- Parameterizing workflows for flexibility  
- Implementing exception handling in libraries  
- Managing dependencies and versioning  
- Reusing libraries across multiple projects
