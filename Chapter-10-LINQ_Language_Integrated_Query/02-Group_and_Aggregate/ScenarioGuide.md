# 📂 Case 02 - Group & Aggregate

## 📄 Description
Summarize and aggregate data by a specific column or category using LINQ.  
This allows you to generate totals, counts, or averages without manual loops.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn to group data by a column (e.g., Category).  
- Perform aggregate operations like `Sum`, `Count`, or `Average`.  
- Export aggregated results to Excel for reporting purposes.

---

## 🛠️ Activities / Components
- `Read Range` / `Excel Application Scope`  
- `Assign` (for LINQ group and aggregate queries)  
- `CopyToDataTable` (if converting grouped data to DataTable)  
- `Write Range` (export aggregated result)  
- `Log Message` (optional, for verification)

## 🚀 Hands-On Steps
1. Read `Orders.xlsx` into a DataTable (`dtOrders`).  
2. Assign grouped and aggregated data to a new variable using LINQ:  
   ```vbnet
   dtGrouped = dtOrders.AsEnumerable().
       Group By cat = Function(r) r("Category") 
       Into TotalAmount = Sum(Function(r) r("Amount")), Count = Count()
       Select Category = cat, TotalAmount, Count
       CopyToDataTable()
   ```
