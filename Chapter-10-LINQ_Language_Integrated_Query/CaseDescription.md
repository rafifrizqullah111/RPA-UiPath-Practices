# ðŸ“˜ Language Integrated Query Practice (UiPath)

This section contains **hands-on practice cases** for mastering LINQ queries in UiPath.  
Each case simulates common data manipulation scenarios using DataTable, List, and Array objects.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Cases Overview

### 01. Filter Rows
- Apply conditions to extract subset of data.  
- **Covers:** `Where`, filtering DataTable rows, CopyToDataTable.  

### 02. Group & Aggregate
- Summarize data by category, count, or sum.  
- **Covers:** `Group By`, `Sum`, `Count`, custom aggregation.  

### 03. Top-N Selection
- Select the largest/smallest N records.  
- **Covers:** `OrderBy`, `OrderByDescending`, `Take`, `Skip`.  

### 04. Transform & Projection
- Convert dataset into another shape (List, Dictionary, anonymous object).  
- **Covers:** `Select`, `Distinct`, mapping to new structure.  

### 05. Join Two Tables
- Combine data from two sources by matching keys.  
- **Covers:** `Join`, inner join, left join with LINQ syntax.  

### 06. Distinct & Deduplication
- Remove duplicates and get unique values from data.  
- **Covers:** `Distinct`, custom equality, deduplication by column.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
By completing these 6 cases, you will gain hands-on experience in:  
- Writing LINQ queries for common business scenarios  
- Replacing repetitive loops with concise one-liners  
- Performing advanced data manipulation (joins, grouping, top-N, deduplication)  
- Boosting performance of UiPath robots when processing large datasets
