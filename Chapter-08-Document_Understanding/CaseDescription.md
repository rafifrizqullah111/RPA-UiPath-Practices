# ðŸ“˜ Document Understanding Practice (UiPath)

This section contains **hands-on practice cases** for learning Document Understanding in UiPath.  
Each case is designed with sample data and clear objectives, so you can apply them directly in automation workflows.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Cases Overview

### 01. Document Classification
- Automatically classify incoming documents (invoice, receipt, forms) into categories.  
- **Covers:** `Taxonomy Manager`, `Load Taxonomy`, `Digitize Document`, `Classify Document Scope`, `Present Classification Station`.

### 02. OCR Extraction (Structured & Semi-Structured)
- Extract text data from scanned documents or PDFs using OCR.  
- **Covers:** `Digitize Document`, `Read PDF with OCR`, `Read Handwritten Text`, `Tesseract OCR`, `OmniPage OCR`.

### 03. Data Extraction with ML Models
- Use Machine Learning Extractor to capture fields (e.g., invoice number, total).  
- **Covers:** `Data Extraction Scope`, `ML Extractor`, `Assign`, `Write Range`.

### 04. Validation Station for Human-in-the-Loop
- Route extracted data to humans for validation before storing results.  
- **Covers:** `Present Validation Station`, `Human in the Loop`, `Validation Action Center`.

### 05. Handling Semi-Structured Invoices
- Extract data from invoices with varying layouts and vendors.  
- **Covers:** `Form Extractor`, `Regex Extractor`, `ML Extractor`, `Anchor Base`.

### 06. Extract Data from Forms
- Capture fields from structured forms (e.g., HR request form).  
- **Covers:** `Form Extractor`, `Data Extraction Scope`, `Assign`, `Write Cell`.

### 07. Combine Multiple Extraction Methods
- Apply hybrid extraction (keyword, regex, ML) for maximum accuracy.  
- **Covers:** `Regex Extractor`, `Keyword Based Extractor`, `ML Extractor`, `If`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
By completing these 7 cases, you will gain hands-on experience in:  
- Classifying and categorizing documents  
- Extracting text from scanned and native PDFs  
- Using machine learning for field-level extraction  
- Building workflows with human validation in the loop  
- Handling both structured and semi-structured documents  
- Designing hybrid approaches to improve accuracy  

This practice set is designed to mimic **real-world document automation needs** in enterprise workflows.
