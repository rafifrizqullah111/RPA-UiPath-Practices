## ðŸ“‚ Cases Overview

### 01. Document Classification
- Automatically classify documents into categories such as invoices, receipts, purchase orders, or contracts.  
- **Covers:** `Digitize Document`, `Classification Station`, `Keyword Based Classifier`, `Machine Learning Classifier`.

### 02. OCR Extraction
- Extract text from scanned or image-based PDF documents using OCR.  
- **Covers:** `Digitize Document`, `OCR Engine (Tesseract, OmniPage, Microsoft)`, `Read PDF with OCR`.

### 03. Data Extraction
- Extract structured data fields such as Invoice Number, Vendor Name, or Total Amount.  
- **Covers:** `Data Extraction Scope`, `Regex Based Extractor`, `ML Extractor`, `Keyword Based Extractor`.

### 04. Document Classification (Advanced Routing)
- Enhance classification by routing documents automatically to the right process flow.  
- **Covers:** `Keyword Based Classifier`, `ML Classifier`, `Export Extraction Results`.

### 05. Extract Data from Unstructured Documents
- Process unstructured files such as contracts or resumes and extract meaningful information.  
- **Covers:** `Digitize Document`, `Regex Extractor`, `ML Extractor`, `Export Extraction Results`.

### 06. Train & Evaluate ML Extractor
- Train and evaluate custom ML models for extracting data fields from documents.  
- **Covers:** `Machine Learning Extractor`, `AI Center`, `Export Extraction Results`.

### 07. Validation Station (Human-in-the-loop)
- Integrate **human validation** to review and correct extracted fields before final processing.  
- **Covers:** `Validation Station`, `Data Extraction Scope`, `Write Range`, `Export Extraction Results`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
By completing these 7 cases, you will gain hands-on experience in:  
- Classifying and routing documents  
- Extracting text using OCR engines  
- Capturing structured and unstructured data fields  
- Training and evaluating ML extractors  
- Applying human-in-the-loop validation for accuracy  

This practice set is designed to mimic **real-world document processing** in finance, HR, procurement, and other business processes.
